Rectangle.java

This file is the Rectangle class that contains the methods getWidth(), getLength(), and compareTo(Rectangle r).
There are 2 instance variables for the length and the width of the rectangle.
The getWidth method returns the width, the getLength method returns the length, the perimeter method takes length and
width as arguments and returns the perimeter. It is private because it doesn't need to be accessed by outside functions.

Problem1.java

This file contains the findMax method that returns the rectangle with the largest parameter. This is identical to what
was provided. It also contains the Main method, which tests the findMax method by creating and array of rectangles
and finding the one with the largest perimeter among them.

Problem2.java

The file contains the binarySearch method which uses the helper function to recursively find Rectangle x in array a
 and returns the index. The main method tests this recursive search.

 Problem3.java

This file contains the code fragments of question 3 and prints the run times for all of them using the System clock


Problem3.txt

contains the results and explanations of the times obtained
